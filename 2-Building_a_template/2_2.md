## Now, let us build a template to display this data!

For each *value* associated to a *key* in our data object, we use the Handlebars syntax to place our values.

An example would be...

```handlebars
<article>
Hi, my name is {{name}}! My favourite colour is {{colour}} and I enjoy eating at {{restaurant}}!
</article>
```

**Notice the `{{value}}` notation**!

Now, save this to a file in a directory called `templates`. You can really place it anywhere. I've provided a sample application in this Github repository (under the folder named `example`). Mine will be placed inside of there.

When I save a template, I will name it as `myTemplate.hbs`. You can also name it as `myTemplate.handlebars`... whatever floats your boat.
